# Online-Library-and-Bookplace
The purpose of the Project is to convert the physical Library System into an Internet and Cloud-based application and it happens to be a Bookplace as well. All the requirements that a user demands from a Physical Library is proposed to be implemented in the Online Library system while enhancing the functionality and supplementing the Library System with a Bookplace where other users known as Book Hosts can host their books and make it available to normal users. An important purpose of this project is to digitalize and decentralize the library system and build an ecosystem where more people can have access to books via the Bookplace platform.

The Bookplace platform makes this library system decentralized i.e. the books will be made available not only by libraries but by other users (known as Book Hosts) as well. This helps in making this process decentralized as users can easily find and rent books hosted by other users – which facilitates in scenarios where libraries don’t have the required book available or if the library is too far away. Hence, our product becomes an all-inclusive destination for avid readers or researchers to find their next read.
